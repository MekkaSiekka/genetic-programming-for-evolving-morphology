# Genetic Programming for Evolving Morphology

An algorithm to evolve robot with various morphology using genetic programming

## Prerequisite
OS: I only use Ubuntu but it is very easy to use VS etc. to have fun with this repo

For visualization you need Vpython to run *main.py*

It is recommended to install vpyhon in a environment

## Execution
To compile the code you can simply run on terminal:
```
bash  script.sh
```
It will compile the program and automatically start running `a.out`

## Inspiration
The project is inspired by an evolutionary algorithm for symbolic regression that uses tree representation for function expression to fit datapoints. The implementation can be found here: [GPlearn](https://gplearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html)
